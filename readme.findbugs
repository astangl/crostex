To get findbugs ant task to work, install FindBugs on your system (from
findbugs.sourceforge.net), copy $FINDBUGS_HOME/lib/findbugs-ant.jar into
the lib subdirectory of your ant installation (or, e.g., ~/.ant/lib).
Also, environment variable FINDBUGS_HOME needs to point to the directory
where FindBugs is installed, or else edit the line in build.xml which
sets findbugs.home property, to explicitly set it to your FindBugs dir.
